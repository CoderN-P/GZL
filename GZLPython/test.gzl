~~
This is a simple GZL program that calculates the fibonacci number of a given number.
~~

x = 100 ratio 10 ~setting variable x to 10 (100/10 = 10)

vibe fibonacci(x) {
    sus x <= 1 {
        drop x ~returning x if x is less than or equal to 1
    }
    drop fibonacci(x - 1) + fibonacci(x - 2) ~returning the sum of the two previous fibonacci numbers
}

yap(fibonacci(x)) ~printing the fibonacci number of x
